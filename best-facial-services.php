                            <p>A recent survey conducted by Beauty Magazine suggests that one of the favorite ways for women to rejuvenate themselves is to take refuge in facials. This has become an obsession around the globe for the multiple benefits they give. One cannot point towards any con of getting a facial done. From improved blood circulation to diminishing fine lines, from extreme hydration to removal of dead skin cells, there is nothing that a good facial session can’t do. </p>

                            <p>You ask: should I get a facial? We say, by all means, you should. Nothing can match the feeling of an after-facial glow and the charm of gliding fingers over smooth, soft, and milky skin. It is important you take out time once every fortnight, if not, a month at least to pamper your skin in the right way. If you still are not convinced, read the guide given below to know the reasons behind never skipping a facial appointment. </p>
                            
                            <h3 class="blog-title-small">Reduce Stress and Relieve Psychological Distress</h3>
                            <p>From the moment you lay your head on the facial bed to the minute you open your eyes after the facial is done, you will notice a complete change and reduction in anxiety levels. This is not a claim made by us but by a study published in the Biomedical Research Journal. </p>
                            <h3 class="blog-title-small">Deep Cleansing</h3>
                            <p>While we all follow some sort of daily cleansing routine, we underestimate the importance of <a href="facial.php" data-toggle="tooltip" title="deep cleansing facial">deep cleansing facial</a> and exfoliation. A facial cleansing does so thoroughly, promoting skin hydration and extraction of gunk from pores, something that is not possible at home. </p>
                            <h3 class="blog-title-small">Reduction of Fine Lines and Hyperpigmentation</h3>
                            <p>Facials help in boosting collagen production and cell regeneration. This further enables your skin to fight degeneration and aging due to high levels of pollution found anywhere you go.</p>
                            <h3 class="blog-title-small">Promotes Blood Circulation</h3>
                            <p>Continuous massage during the facial service promotes blood circulation considerably. When this is promoted, there is no way you won’t glow. </p>
                            <h3 class="blog-title-small">Eliminate Whiteheads and Blackheads</h3>
                            <p>When even after multiple efforts at home, you cannot get rid of these enemies, a facial will give you the solution. Even after just one setting, you will notice a huge difference.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>In praise of facials, there is no end to this long list. We can go on and on about how they detoxify skin, tighten and reduce pore size, treat acne and acne marks, as well as reduce under-eye bags and dark circles.</p>
                            <p>Since facials provide so many benefits, after a number of studies and research, many specialized forms of <a href="facial.php" data-toggle="tooltip" title="facials">facials</a> have been devised by experts in the field of dermatology and beauty.</p>
